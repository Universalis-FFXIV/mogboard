            <p>
                <strong>Universalis</strong> runs a REST API that applications can post market board data to,
                after they collect the data from a running game instance by multiple users, anonymously.
            <p>
                It stores this data, and reports it back to anyone that requests its endpoints - including this frontend,
                which visualizes the stored data and notifies you about changes.
            </p>
