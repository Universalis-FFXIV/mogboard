    <small>NEW UPDATES</small>

    <div>
        Major server maintenance has been performed on both XIVAPI and Mogboard
        to alleviate very problematic infrastructure issues as well as allow
        better monitoring and scaling of the service. I am watching many reports
        and keeping an eye on things to ensure things run smoothly however there
        may be intermittent downtime.
    </div>

    <div>
        Regarding item-update: Square-Enix are being heavily pro-active in banning
        accounts that crawl the Companion API. Whenever their servers have
        technical issues, I can guarantee an account or 2 will get banned... With
        huge congestion and servers locked from new characters it is difficult
        to recover at this time. Updating will remain in slow mode until things
        improve.
