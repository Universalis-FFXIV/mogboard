    <strong>NO ITEMS WILL BE UPDATING FOR THE REST OF DAY</strong><br>
    Due to server congestion, I have decided to not risk the MogBoard accounts and so no item updates will
    be performed for the remainder of the day. I will check server stability as often as possible (GMT).
    I am really sorry for the inconvenience.
